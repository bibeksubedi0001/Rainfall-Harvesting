# Rainfall Harvesting Potential Analysis

This project calculates and visualizes the potential for rainwater harvesting in urban areas. By analyzing rainfall data and rooftop areas, it provides detailed insights into rainwater collection potential, seasonal contributions, and efficiency simulations at varying runoff coefficients.

## Features

- **Rainfall Data Analysis**:
  - Monthly and seasonal rainfall trends.
  - Cumulative rainfall visualization.
  - Rainfall distribution with outliers highlighted.

- **Rainwater Harvesting Potential**:
  - Calculates total water collection potential for buildings.
  - Identifies top buildings by collection potential.

- **Efficiency Simulations**:
  - Compares water collection potential across different runoff coefficients.

- **Comprehensive Visualizations**:
  - Bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and cumulative trends.
  - Outputs stored in a structured directory.
